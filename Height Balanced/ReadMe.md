# Height Balanced Binary Tree
Checking if a binary tree is height balanced is essentially finding if the height of left subtree and right subtree of every node differs at max by 1 unit...

The implementation of this is pretty tricky if we want O(n) time complexity...

If we want O(n) time complexity, we want to return two types of values simultaneously from one function. Thefirst value is going to be a boolean indicating if the tree is balanced till now
and second value will be an integer indicating height of the current tree (including root node)...

To do this we can use a pair of bool and int, but there is another tricky approach to do it without using pair...
To do this, we need to return a value of -1, if left subtree or right subtree is not balanced and return either 0 or positive value indicating the height of the left or right subtree and it also  means that it is balanced till now...
