# Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree is a special kind of data structure, which is represented in same was as a binary tree, but support quicker time complexity when it comes to operations...

### A balanced binary search tree gives following advantages:
| Operation      | Time Complexity |
| :------:       |    :----:       |
| Searching      | O(log n)           |
| Inserting      | O(log n)           |
| Deleting       | O(log n)           |
| Find Closest   | O(log n)           |
| Sorted Traversal| O(log n)          |
